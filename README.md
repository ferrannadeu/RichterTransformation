## Abstract

Richter transformation (RT) is a paradigmatic evolution of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into a very aggressive large B-cell lymphoma conferring a dismal prognosis. The mechanisms driving RT remain largely unknown. We have characterized the whole genome, epigenome and transcriptome, combined with single-cell DNA/RNA sequencing analyses and functional experiments, of 19 CLL developing RT. Studying 54 longitudinal samples covering up to 19 years of disease course, we uncovered minute subclones carrying genomic, immunogenetic, and transcriptomic features of RT-cells already at CLL diagnosis, which were dormant for up to 19 years before transformation. We also identified new driver alterations, discovered a novel mutational signature (SBS-RT), recognized an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)high-B-cell receptor signaling (BCR)low transcriptional axis in RT, and showed that OXPHOS inhibition reduces the proliferation of RT cells. These findings demonstrate the early seeding of subclones driving advanced stages of cancer evolution and uncover therapeutic targets for the, once expanded, lethal RT.
